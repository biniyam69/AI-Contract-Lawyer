# CONTRACT LAWYER RAG

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system for Contract Q&A. The project aims to build, evaluate, and improve a RAG system capable of answering questions related to legal contracts autonomously. The system leverages Langchain, a leading LLM application framework, for development and evaluation.

## Objectives
- Build a RAG system for Contract Q&A using Langchain.
- Evaluate the performance of the RAG system using predefined metrics and benchmarks.
- Implement enhancements to optimize the Contract Q&A process.
- Interpret and report the findings, including incremental improvements achieved.

## Tasks
The project is structured into several tasks, including:
1. Literature Review and Trend Analysis
2. Understanding RAG Performance Metrics
3. Efficiency and Scalability Optimization
4. Personalization and Contextualization
5. Bias Reduction
6. Planning and Design of Q&A Pipeline
7. Development of Retrieval and Generation Components
8. Integration and Testing
9. Building a RAG Evaluation Pipeline
10. Optimization Ideas for Contract Q&A
11. Implementation of Enhancements
12. Interpretation & Reporting

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Langchain framework
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
